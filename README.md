# Ottawa-Traffic-Accident-Data-Modelling-and-Analytics
This project is an end-to-end data science and analytics project which includes data mart design, data collecting, data cleaning, data modelling, data visualization.

1. Project Theme

The project theme is to design an integrated data mart for the traffic accidents of the city of Ottawa for the period 2014-2017 and explore the correlations to the different features.
